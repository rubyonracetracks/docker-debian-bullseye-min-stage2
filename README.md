# Docker Debian Bullseye - Minimal - Stage 2

This repository is used for building the Stage 2 Minimal Debian Bullseye Docker image for [Ruby on Racetracks](https://www.rubyonracetracks.com/).

## Name of This Docker Image
[ghcr.io/rubyonracetracks/docker-debian-bullseye-min-stage2](https://github.com/rubyonracetracks/docker-debian-bullseye-min-stage2/pkgs/container/docker-debian-bullseye-min-stage2)

## Upstream Docker Image
[Official Debian Bullseye Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian)

## What's Added

## What's the Point?
* This Docker image is a basic building block for other Docker images for [Ruby on Racetracks](https://www.rubyonracetracks.com/).
* This Docker image is deliberately kept small in to minimize the time needed for building, uploading, and downloading this image.  This is useful for getting quick feedback when experimenting.
